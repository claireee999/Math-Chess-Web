        "Single Hop: A single hop refers to a chess piece being able to jump over several other chess pieces in the same straight line. However, the condition is that the numbers of the pieces being jumped over must be obtained through one or more arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, and the result should be the number of the piece to be hopped over. Single hop is a type of mathematical problem with multiple solutions, meaning that a single problem can have several different solutions. It is often used to develop students' divergent thinking skills. It is also a type of problem where the answer is known, and the goal is to find the algorithm, which helps cultivate students' reverse thinking abilities. ",
        "Consecutive Hop: Consecutive hop means that a chess piece can continuously hop over segments of chess pieces that can yield the same result. "
